# multithreaded_AI_LISP
This multithreaded genetic algorithm written in list optimizes a floating point vector, the parameters for this optimization (mutaion chance, mutaion variance ect..) is optimized by a higher-order genetic algorithm. This project was created for an artificial intelligence class in spring 2020. This was written in LISP sbcl.
